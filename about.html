    <p>
        My name is Nick Fraus. <br>
        I am a:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game Developer</li>

        I was born and raised in Troy, MI. I started studying at MSU in 2020 as a computer science major. After meeting my best friend Eric the next year, I switched to Game Design.
        I've always loved programming ever since I was first introduced to it in middle school. Coding is more meaningful to me when I am making a game.

        I love animals too! I used to have two dogs named Honey and Sherman. My neighbors are currently fostering two puppies named Oreo and Nugget.
